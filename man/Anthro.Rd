\title{Children anthropometric data}
\description{
The dataset consists of 1007 observations and 6 variables of children aged between 0 and 60 months from the Central-West of Brazil. The data is a subset of the 2006 Brazilian National Demographic Health Survey of Women and Children (NDHS), which is a complex survey where the sampling units were selected in two stages: primary sampling units (PSUs) comprised census tracts, and secondary sampling units (SSUs) consisted of households. Tract selection in each stratum was designed to ensure a minimum number of blood samples, based on the prevalence of vitamin A deficiency in children.
