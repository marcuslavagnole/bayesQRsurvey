\title{Children anthropometric data}
\description{
The dataset comprises 1007 observations and 6 variables on children aged 0-60 months from the Central-West region of Brazil. The data are a subset of the 2006 Brazilian National Demographic Health Survey of Women and Children (NDHS), a complex survey in which sampling units were selected in two stages: primary sampling units (PSUs) were census tracts, and secondary sampling units (SSUs) were households. Tract selection within each stratum was designed to ensure a minimum number of blood samples, given the prevalence of vitamin A deficiency in children.
